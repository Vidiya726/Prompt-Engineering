# Prompt-Engineering
Write a bedtime story about a bat who is afraid of dark for children aged 5 to 7.

## AIM:
The story aims to teach young children about the importance of perseverance and problem-solving when facing difficulties. It also highlights the value of accepting help from others to achieve a goal.
## ALOGORITHM:
**1. Discovery**:

Action: Lyra searches for a lost spring in the attic.

Result: She finds a loose floorboard and an ornate keyhole.

**2. Search and Connection**:

Action: Lyra searches the attic for a key.

Result: She finds a tarnished, oddly shaped key that fits the keyhole.

**3. Revelation**:

Action: Lyra uses the key.

Result: A section of the wall swings inward, revealing a secret room and a broken machine.

**4. Problem-Solving**:

Action: Lyra spends days studying, sketching, and cleaning the machine's scattered parts.

Result: She understands how the machine works and carefully reassembles it.

**5. Activation**:

Action: Lyra places the final gear.

Result: The machine hums, lights blink on, and a small robot rolls out.

**6. Friendship and Exploration**:

Action: Lyra names the robot, Pip.

Result: Pip projects images, and together, they begin to explore the "magic" of the machine.

The story is a creative tale about curiosity and discovery. An algorithm, in contrast, would be a precise set of instructions like a recipe or a code. For example, if you wanted to write an algorithm for a robot to find a key, it would look something like this:

Start.

Define Target: Key.

Scan Environment: Search Attic.

Detect Object: Is the object Key?

If Yes: Pick up Key.

If No: Continue Scanning.

If All Areas Scanned and No Key Found: End Process.
## PROGRAM:
# Lyra the Inventor
Lyra loved to invent. Her favorite place was the attic, filled with forgotten treasures and the smell of old wood. Every afternoon, she’d climb the creaky stairs, her mind buzzing with new ideas.

One sunny day, while searching for a lost spring, Lyra noticed a loose floorboard. Beneath it, not dust, but a tiny, ornate keyhole gleamed. Curiosity tugged at her heart.

After much searching, tucked away in an old velvet box, she found a tarnished, oddly shaped key. It fit perfectly! With a soft click, a section of the wall swung inward, revealing a secret room.

Inside, the air was still and thick with forgotten dreams. In the center stood a peculiar machine, made of polished brass and gleaming gears, but clearly broken. Its parts lay scattered like fallen stars.

Lyra’s eyes lit up. This wasn't just old junk; it was a puzzle! She spent days poring over the scattered pieces, sketching diagrams, and carefully cleaning each part.

Finally, with a deep breath, Lyra placed the very last gear. A soft hum filled the room, then a gentle whirring. Lights blinked on, and the machine began to glow.

From a small hatch, a tiny, round robot with blinking eyes rolled out. "Beep-boop!" it chirped, looking up at Lyra. She named him Pip.

Pip wasn't just any robot. With a gentle whir, he projected shimmering images onto the wall – faraway lands, fantastical creatures, and stars that danced.

Lyra hugged Pip gently. She knew this secret room and her new friend were just the beginning of many wonderful adventures. The attic, once just a workshop, was now a gateway to magic.

Every day after school, Lyra and Pip would explore new wonders, always remembering that the greatest discoveries often hide in the most unexpected places.
## OUTPUT:

## RESULT :
Lyra, a young inventor, discovers a secret room and a broken machine in her attic. By fixing the machine, she brings a tiny robot named Pip to life, and they begin a magical journey of exploration together.
