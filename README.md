## PROGRAM:
# Flicker's Shimmering Feather
In a cosy little den, nestled deep within the Whispering Woods, lived a curious young fox named Flicker. She loved to collect shiny things â€“ pebbles that sparkled, dewdrops on spiderwebs, and even the glint from a beetle's shell.

One sunny morning, Flicker saw something truly magnificent. High up in the tallest oak tree, a tiny, shimmering feather caught the sunlight, glowing with all the colours of the rainbow!

"Oh, I must have that!" she whispered, her tail wagging with excitement. But the feather was very, very high. Flicker tried to jump, but it was no use.

She scampered around the tree, looking for a way up. She saw a long, twisty vine hanging down. "Maybe I can climb!" she thought.

Flicker grabbed the vine with her paws and started to pull herself up, slowly but surely. It was hard work, and her little paws were getting tired.

Just as she was about to give up, a wise old owl hooted from a nearby branch. "Hoo-hoo! Little one, sometimes the best treasures are found with a little help."

Flicker looked at the owl, then back at the feather. "But how?" she asked, a little discouraged.

The owl dropped a small, sturdy twig next to Flicker. "Use this to hook the branch above you, then climb higher," hooted the owl kindly.

Flicker carefully took the twig and, with a brave stretch, hooked it onto a branch just above her. With a final push, she scrambled onto the branch!

There it was! The shimmering feather, even more beautiful up close. Flicker gently picked it up, feeling proud and happy. She had learned that sometimes, a little help and a lot of perseverance can lead to the most wonderful discoveries.

## OUTPUT:

Flicker successfully obtains the shimmering feather, feeling proud and happy. She learns that determination, clever solutions, and accepting assistance can lead to wonderful achievements.
